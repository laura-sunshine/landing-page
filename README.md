This project utilised all of the skills I had learnt as part of the flexbox section of The Odin Project. It also utilised
previous skills in HTML and other CSS styling.

The project was real challenge as it involved the coming together of many different skills for a real world application.
It was also really enjoyable, especially as I have been able to work on a project very close to my heart.
